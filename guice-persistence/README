Application is used to show how to use hsqldb for testing using an in memory catalog as
described by the hsqldb documentation:

"mem: stored entirely in RAM - without any persistence beyond the JVM process's life"

The application is simple using JPA/Hibernate to illustrate database persistence and as well as
Google Guice to bootstrap the application and provide Dependency Injection (DI).
